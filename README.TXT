This game was produced as part of a Team Effort by the OOPDA class Fall 2016 Rowan University for Professor S. Weissman.


This Fantasy Football game is designed to produce probabilistic results for a Simulation.
So far it is capable of generating Teams, Players, and a Controller Object.
So far it fails to retrieve player data, run a full game, and print messages to the basic console.

The next phase is to add a Graphical User Interface.

Improvements include getName(), getOverall(), getStrength(), getSpeed(), and getPosition() methods in the Message Class. [G]
Improvements include Class Constructors for Player, Team, Message, Clock, and Randomizer. [SG]
Improvements include a Randomizer Class that uses probability to determine the outcome of a play.[SG]
Improvements include a Team Class that creates teams when instantiated by the Controller class. [G]
Improvemnets include a Player Class that creates players when instantiated by the Controller class.
Improvements include a Controller class that adds Objects to a List of the proper Type. [NG]
Improvements include boundary cases using CRC cards for the design process by teams responsible for code bearing. [SG]
Improvements include the JUnit Testing, Regression testing classes, and Documentation. [G]
Improvements include Continuous Integration methods and .git version control over centralized version control.[NA]


Repository: 

  1.) New Project code has been allegedly been produced via Data Team: Joe 'Che Nice' Dunne. 
  2.) Code was briefly explained, however, not demonstrated.
  3.) Code requires regression and JUnit testing, verification, and updating before Repository upload (Although preliminary code uploading       may be necessary to share updates.)
  4.) Joe Dunne, has sent 'the code' to another updated volume.
  5.) Branch needs to be made for new code.
